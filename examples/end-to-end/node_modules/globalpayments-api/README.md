## Documentation and Examples

You can find the latest SDK documentation along with code examples and test cards on the [Global Payments](https://developer.realexpayments.com) and [Heartland](https://developer.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/documentation) Developer Hubs.

In addition you can find working examples in the our example code repository.

_Quick Tip_: The included [test suite](https://github.com/globalpayments/node-sdk/tree/master/test) can be a great source of code samples for using the SDK!

#### Process a Payment Example

```javascript
const card = new CreditCardData();
card.number = "4111111111111111";
card.expMonth = "12";
card.expYear = "2025";
card.cvn = "123";

card
  .charge(129.99)
  .withCurrency("EUR")
  .execute()
  .then((response) => {
    const result = response.responseCode;
    const message = response.responseMessage;
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    // handle  errors
  });
```

| Amex        | 374101000000608  | 12        | 2025     | 1234 |
| JCB         | 3566000000000000 | 12        | 2025     | 123  |
| Diners Club | 36256000000725   | 12        | 2025     | 123  |

#### Testing Exceptions

During your integration you will want to test for specific issuer responses such as 'Card Declined'. Because our sandbox environments do not actually reach out to issuing banks for authorizations, there are specific transaction amounts and/or card numbers that will trigger gateway and issuing bank responses. Please contact your support representative for a complete listing of values used to simulate transaction AVS/CVV results, declines, errors, and other responses that can be caught in your code. Example error handling code:

```javascript
card
  .charge(-5)
  .withCurrency("USD")
  .withAddress(address)
  .execute()
  .catch((e) => {
    switch (e.name) {
      case BuilderError.constructor.name:
        // handle builder errors
        break;
      case ConfigurationError.constructor.name:
        // handle errors related to your services configuration
        break;
      case GatewayError.constructor.name:
        // handle gateway errors/exceptions
        break;
      case UnsupportedTransactionError.constructor.name:
        // handle errors when the configured gateway doesn't support
        // desired transaction
        break;
      case ApiError.constructor.name:
      default:
        // handle all other errors
        break;
    }
  });
```
